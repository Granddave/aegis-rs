## Getting Started with Aegis-rs

### Installation

The easiest way to install Aegis-rs is by using `cargo`:

```sh
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/Granddave/aegis-rs
```

### Launching Aegis-rs with a Backup File

To start Aegis-rs, simply pass the path to your backup file as an argument and enter password. For example:

```sh
$ aegis-rs ~/Documents/aegis-backup-20230512-193110.json
? Insert Aegis Password ‚Ä∫ ********
```

### Searching for an Entry

Aegis-rs supports fuzzy finding for quickly locating entries. Type a part of the entry's name to filter the list. For instance:

```sh
‚Ä∫ tw
‚ùØ Twitter (@johndoe)
  Twitch (johndoe)
  TeamViewer (johndoe@protonmail.com)
  Bitwarden (johndoe@protonmail.com)
```

### Generating an OTP

Aegis-rs allows you to read the OTP directly in the terminal or paste it using the integrated clipboard support. OTPs are regenerated automatically upon expiration. Here the OTP is displayed, including its remaining validity:

```sh
¬∑ Twitter (@johndoe)
121921 (28s left)
```


### Ways to unlock the Vault

To unlock the Aegis vault Aegis-rs supports the following methods:

1. Password: The password can be passed as an argument or set as an environment variable.
    - Environment variable: `AEGIS_PASSWORD`
    - Argument: `--password <PASSWORD>`
    - Example: `aegis-rs --password hunter2 vault.json`
2. Password file: A file containing the password to unlock the vault.
    - Environment variable: `AEGIS_PASSWORD_FILE`
    - Argument: `--password-file <PASSWORD_FILE>`
    - Example: `aegis-rs --password-file /path/to/password-file vault.json`
3. Password prompt: If no password is provided, Aegis-rs will prompt you to enter the password.
